# AI and ML Demystified 

Traditionally, data analysis has always been characterized by cognitive computing, an approach that becomes
impossible when data sets are large and heterogeneous. It is for the very same reason, that big data was 
criticized as being an overhyped technology. Availability of more data is directly proportional to the 
difficulty of coming up with predictive models that work accurately. Also, traditional statistical
solutions are focused on static analysis that is limited to the analysis of samples that are frozen in time. 
This could obviously result in inaccurate and unreliable conclusions. So in order to predict exact patterns 
in a system ML proposes clever alternatives to analyzing huge volumes of data. It is a step forward from all of statistics, 
computer science and all other emerging applications in the industry. By developing fast and efficient algorithms 
and data-driven models for real-time processing of data, machine learning along with AI is able to produce accurate results and analysis.
